Zhortein's Symfony Skeleton
----------------------------

This is an extension for the official Symfony Skeleton (recommended way for starting new projects using Symfony Flex). 
It's main idea is to keep simplicity of official Skeleton, while adding must-have dependencies and default configs used in Maxdev-Solution for developing 
majority of the projects.
